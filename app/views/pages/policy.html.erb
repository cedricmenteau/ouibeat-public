      <p>This Statement of Privacy applies to the OuiBeat website (http://ouibeat.com/fr/) and Agence Ambassador (our Parisian Event Agency that sells OuiBeat) to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from users of http://ouibeat.com/fr/ (this "Site"). The OuiBeat website is a social media aggregation platform. By using OuiBeat and/or other services, you consent to the data practices described below.  This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through this Site. This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Service (http://ouibeat.com/fr/terms-of-service/) .   As used in this Privacy Policy, the terms “using” and “processing” information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organization or among our affiliates within the France or internationally.</p>

      <h2>1. Information Collection and Use </h2>
      <p>Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Site, services, features and content, to administer your membership (collectively, the "Service") and to enable users to enjoy and easily navigate the Site.</p>

      <h2>2. Personally Identifiable Information </h2>
      <p>When you register with us through the Site and become a OuiBeat member, we will ask you for personally identifiable information. This refers to information about you that can be used to contact or identify you, such as your name, email address, phone number company name, etc. ("Personal Information"). We use your Personal Information mainly to provide the Service and administer your inquiries.   We use your Personal Information mainly to provide the Service, and administer your inquiries.   We also use your Personal Information to contact you with OuiBeat newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications.</p>

      <h2>3. Log Data </h2>
      <p>When you visit the Site, whether as a OuiBeat member or a non-registered user just browsing (any of these, a "OuiBeat User"), our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Site, pages of our Site that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Site, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Site and the Service and for the Site's technical administration, to increase our site's functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our visitors’ needs. We also use this information to verify that visitors to the Site meet the criteria required to process their requests. We do not treat Log Data as Personal Information or use it in association with other Personal Information.</p>

      <h2>4. Cookies </h2>
      <p>Like many websites, we use "cookies" to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies for two purposes. First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Site. Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Site, to better understand how you interact with the Site and to monitor aggregate usage by OuiBeat Users and web traffic routing on the Site. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Site and Service and then close your browser. Third party advertisers on the Site may also place or read cookies on your browser. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or all functionality of the Service.</p>

      <h2>5. Service Providers </h2>
      <p>We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service, to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Site-related services (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and improvement of the Site's features) or to assist us in analyzing how our Site and Service are used. These third parties may have access to your Personal Information; if they do, this access is only so that they may perform these tasks on our behalf and they are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose. We may also provide Personal Information to our business partners or other trusted entities for the purpose of providing you with information on goods or services we believe will be of interest to you. You can, at any time, opt out of receiving such communications. Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to OuiBeat. You can disable these specific cookies that track prior visits for the sake of follow-up advertising by opting out at http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ads/.</p>

      <h2>6. Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement </h2>
      <p>OuiBeat cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of OuiBeat or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.</p>

      <h2>7. International Transfer</h2>
      <p>Your information may be transferred to - and maintained on - computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside France and choose to provide information to us, OuiBeat transfers personal information to France and processes it there. Your consent to this privacy policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>

      <h2>8. Business Transfers </h2>
      <p>OuiBeat may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy.</p>

      <h2>9. Changing or Deleting Your Information </h2>
      <p>All OuiBeat members may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information in their registration profile by contacting us at serviceclient@ouibeat.com or editing the relevant part of their profile. If you would like us to delete your record in our system, please contact us and we will attempt to accommodate your request if we do not have any legal obligation to retain the record. See below for privacy contact information.</p>

      <h2>10. Security </h2>
      <p>OuiBeat is very concerned with safeguarding your information. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us at serviceclient@ouibeat.com.</p>

      <h2>11. Links to Other Sites </h2>
      <p>Our Site contains links to other websites. If you choose to visit an advertiser by "clicking on" a banner ad or other type of advertisement, or click on another third party link, you will be directed to that third party's website. The fact that we link to a website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.</p>

      <h2>12. Our Policy Toward Children</h2>
      <p>This Site is not directed to children under 18. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at serviceclient@ouibeat.com. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete such information from our files.</p>

      <h2>13. Contacting Us </h2>
